# About Me  

Hello! 👋 My name is Dmitry Karyakin, and I’m a frontend developer based in Svetlogorsk, Russia. 🌊 From time to time, I visit my home village of Tulgan in the Orenburg region, where my parents live. 🏡  

In my free time, I enjoy staying active 🏃, playing with my children 👨‍👧‍👦, and working on small projects around the house 🛠️. During the week, I practice yoga 🧘 or go for a run; on weekends, if the weather is kind, you’ll often find me flying my paraglider 🪂 or kiteboarding 🏄‍♂️. I also love exploring mountains ⛰️, forests 🌲 — and I never say no to a good drive 🚗.  

As a developer, I mainly work with TypeScript, React, and Ant Design 💻. If you’d like to know more about my IT background, feel free to check out my [resume](/resume.md).  

This website is my corner of the internet 🌐, where I share small experiments, random curiosities, and ideas that inspire me. ✨ I hope you enjoy your visit! 😄
