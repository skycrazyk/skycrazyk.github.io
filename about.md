Hello there! My name is Dmitry Karyakin and I am a frontend developer. I live in Svetlogorsk, Russia, but sometimes I visit my home village of Tulgan in the Orenburg region where my parents live. In my free time, I enjoy sports, playing with my children or tinkering around the house. During the week, I do yoga or go for a run, and on the weekends, if the weather is good, I fly a paraglider or go kiteboarding. I also love exploring mountains, forests, seashores, rivers and driving.

As a frontend developer, most of my work involves using TypeScript, React, and Ant Design. If you would like to learn more about my IT background, please visit my [resume page](/resume.md). 

This website is where I share my simple and silly experiments and some of the things that interest me over time. I hope you enjoy it!
