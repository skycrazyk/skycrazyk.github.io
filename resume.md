## About Me  

I am passionate about writing **clean, scalable code** and enjoy refactoring to improve existing solutions. I have strong experience in reading, debugging, profiling, and optimizing code. I believe in the importance of **TypeScript** for large-scale projects and approach code reviews with great attention to detail.  

In my free time, I enjoy walking, paragliding, and spending time with my family.
