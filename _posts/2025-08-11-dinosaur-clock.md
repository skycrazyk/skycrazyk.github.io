title: Dinosaur clock
---

The idea to recreate a chess clock came up when my daughter and I were playing a game called "Name a Dinosaur". The rules are simple: players take turns naming prehistoric animals. In order to add some spice to this monotonous game, it was a good idea to use a chess clock to limit reflection time.

The only difference between classic chess clocks and dinosaur clocks is that the latter support up to 4 players.
